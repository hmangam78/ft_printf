# ft_printf
ft_printf is a small reimplementation of the standard C library function printf, developed as part of the curriculum at School 42. The goal of this project is to reproduce a subset of printf functionality while following 42's coding standards and learning about variadic functions, formatting, and low-level string/number handling in C.
